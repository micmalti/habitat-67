<!-- ## Banner -->
<!-- Creating a banner is fairly straightforward. Find a ready-made Freepik icon (don't forget to mention it in the Credits section), or use an AI icon generator for a more personal touch. Then, import the icon into the boilerplate .xcf file, update the project name and possibly the font kerning, and export the banner twice to support both dark and light themes (according to a Reddit poll from 2022, 85% of GitHub users use dark mode). -->

## Installation
<!-- Highlight any requirements which must be present on the system prior to installing the software. Consider splitting this section according to the various packaging modes that are available. -->

### Requirements

A *nix-based (Linux, BSD, Mac) system with `bash`, `git`, and `uv` installed. Windows users must enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and install the latest Ubuntu LTS distribution.

GitHub is assumed to host the public git repository for your project. For this reason, you will need to have a GitHub account, configure Git to use it, and install the GitHub CLI. Also, to have code coverage available via Codecov, you will need to sign up for a Codecov account and install the Codecov app on your GitHub account to grant it access to the GitHub API. Once the repository is available on GitHub,  for the token that will be used by Codecov in the GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate uploading your coverage reports.
After your repository is on GitHub, [create a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets) to store the Codecov token, available in the Configuration page of that repository under your Codecov account). This token will allow the GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate and upload coverage reports.

For private repositories, you may also need to allow access Codecov in the app configuration.

A further require
1. Install cruft
`uv tool install cruft`

2. Initialize the project
`cruft create https://github.com/micmalti/cookiepy`

## Usage
<!-- Provide examples of likely tasks involving the project. Sub-sections may be added in the form of an FAQ for clarity. -->

By using `cruft`, your template will be able to receive future updates when they become available. This is further facilitated by the automated creation of a pull request each time there are changes detected which a maintainer can accept or reject.

<!-- ### Default configuration options -->
<!-- Mention the use of the `.cookiecutterrc` file: https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/user_config.html -->
<!-- The intended usage of this template is for open-source projects, which is why the remote GitHub repository is set to be public by default. If you wish to start off private and then release the project later on, you can still use version control but not push your changes to the -->

<!-- ### Building MkDocs locally -->
<!-- The package must be available to MkDocs as an editable install. From the root folder:
pip install -e .
 -->

<!--  -->
For the documentation page to be visible, visit your repository Settings > Pages. Under Build and Deployment, select 'Deploy from a branch', and set 'gh-pages' as the deployment branch with '/ (root)'.

<!-- Rationale for using editable installs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlX5HDg1Zp8
Going with the src layout is just a way to ensure that the tests are running against the packaged version. Remember to rerun the editable installation process if you edit pyproject.toml.
-->
<!-- Choice of not installing pytest plugins was deliberate as it varies depending on the nature of the project and user preferences -->
<!-- In Codecov vs Coveralls, I went with Codecov because of better pricing tiers and it being backed by Sentry. -->
<!-- The rationale for using pre-commit is to avoid the cumbersome task of revoking the exposed credentials and rewriting the Git history if they have been accidentally committed -->

<!-- Plans ahead -->
<!-- This template is intended to reduce the user configuration required to start writing Python code. It should be up to the user to decide which CLI library to use, which would be just a matter of executing `uv add <package>`. Python serves different niches, each with its own set of libraries (and best practices). Three prominent ones are data science/ML, web development, and CLI libraries. My wish is to expand this template to get you started in each of these domains, but doing so inevitably leads to bias regarding the choice of tooling used. Sure, the best practices can be included, but I don't see why users should be constrained with my own choice of project dependencies. -->

<!-- Coverage -->
<!-- For code coverage to become functional, you need to have a Codecov account and configure the [GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/codecov) to scan your repository (if it is set to private) -->

<!-- In GitHub Actions, the `fetch-depth` keyword is intended for limiting the number of commits fetched from a repository, saving bandwidth. However, there isn't a clean way of doing this at the moment that will ensure different events are handled properly, so it's left undeclared: https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/1444  -->

<!--
Apart from the desired functionality, the choice of which VS Code extensions to include depended on the ease with which their underlying library could be made available in a CI runner, such that [both environments are matched](https://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity).

Personally, I find all-in-one libraries to be difficult to maintain long-term and prefer the Unix philosophy of implementing separate tools that work in concert, just like this template after all. It's for this reason that I have refrained from admitting `hatch` into this template, opting instead to use `nox` for environment management and `meson` as build backend. Meanwhile, `uv` was chosen as a more performant alternative to managing dependencies than `pip`, which especially matters in CI, but since it doesn't play along with `pyenv` (a Python version manager), it had to subsume its functionality as well.

While `uv.lock` ensures reproducibility by tracking the exact version of your project's dependencies, it's not an official PEP-backed lock file format that every package manager support. Thus, to keep your project accessible to non-`uv` workflows, dependencies are also tracked in `pyproject.toml`. This is a good [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1b9b07s/when_do_you_choose_to_upgrade_your_dependencies/) on the need for continuous upgrades.

## Support
<!--
Update this section to ask for financial support. GitHub Sponsors for individual accounts can be set up quite easily, but organizations will require a fiscal host and Open Collective can be one such option, providing full transparency of where money comes from and how it’s spent. This mostly applies for the maintainers of popular open-source projects who would benefit from not having to manage all the taxes, accounting, and financial administration themselves in order to accept donations while ensuring that if they move on, the financial support towards their projects can continue. Liberapay is also an open-source donations platform, but it only supports recurring donations and doesn't provide a financial host.
