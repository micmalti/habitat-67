## Checklist

Before interacting within the project, please take a moment to consider the following questions. By doing so, you can ensure that you are using the correct issue template and that you provide all necessary information when interacting with our community.

Issues, discussions, and comments are forever

Please note that everything you write is permanent and will remain for everyone to read – forever. Therefore, please always be nice and constructive, follow our contribution guidelines, and comply with our Code of Conduct.

### Before creating an issue

- Are you using the appropriate issue template, or is there another issue template that better fits the context of your request?
- Have you checked if a similar bug report or change request has already been created, or have you stumbled upon something that might be related?
- Did your fill out every field as requested and did you provide any additional information that we maintainers need to comprehend your request?

### Before asking a question

- Is the topic a question for our discussion board, or is it a bug report or change request that should better be raised on our issue tracker?
- Is there an open discussion on the topic of your request? If the answer is yes, does your question match the direction of the discussion, or should you open a new discussion?
- Did your provide our community with all the necessary information to understand your question and help you quickly, or can you make it easier to help you?

### Before commenting

- Is your comment relevant to the topic of the current page, post, issue, or discussion, or is it a better idea to create a new issue or discussion?
- Does your comment add value to the conversation? Is it constructive and respectful to our community and us maintainers? Could you just use a reaction instead? Use reactions to say thanks as this reduces the noise for moderators and people who are involved in a thread.

## Questions

The GitHub issue tracker is for *bug reports* and *feature requests*. Please do not use it to ask questions about how to use habitat-67. These questions should instead be directed to GitHub Discussions.

## Code of Conduct

Everyone participating in this project is encouraged to be familiar with and uphold the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which helps guide our collaborative efforts. Your participation signifies your agreement to its principles.

## Reporting Bugs

### Good Reporting Practices

Please be aware of the following things when filing bug reports:

- **Avoid raising duplicate issues**. Please use the GitHub issue search feature to check whether your bug report or feature request has been mentioned in the past. Duplicate bug reports and feature requests are a huge maintenance burden on the limited resources of the project.
- When filing bug reports, **be as thorough as possible**. This means you should provide:
    - Guidance on how to reproduce the issue. Ideally, this should be a small code sample that can be run immediately by the maintainers. Failing that, let us know what you're doing, how often it happens, what environment you're using, etc. Be thorough: it prevents us needing to ask further questions.
    - Tell us **what you expected to happen**. When we run your example code, what are we expecting to happen? What does "success" look like for your code?
    - Tell us **what actually happens**. It's not helpful for you to say "it doesn't work" or "it fails". Tell us *how* it fails.
    - Specify what version of habitat-67 you are using, and the chosen mode of installation.

Issues that lack sufficient detail for reproducibility will be marked as `stale` and [automatically closed within 48 hours](https://github.com/tiangolo/issue-manager) unless more information is forthcoming.

## Suggesting Enhancements

## Contributing Code

We maintain a curated list of small issues suited to first-time or less experienced contributors, using the “easy pickings” filter. These are strongly recommended for those contributors looking to make a contribution.

Ideally, pull requests ought to be submitted in response to an open issue. This helps increase the specificity of your PR and will increase the likelihood that your contribution will be accepted.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

Refer to the [Getting Started]() section in the template documentation for details.

### Contribution Workflow

### Contribution Suitability

Project maintainers have the last word on whether a contribution is suitable for habitat-67. All contributions will be considered carefully, but from time to time, contributions will be rejected because they do not suit the current goals or needs of the project.
