# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, the contributors and maintainers of this project ("the Community"), are committed to fostering an environment where all participants can join and collaborate effectively. To ensure this, we agree to strive to meet our community's standards for positive conduct ("Encouraged Behaviours") and to avoid engaging in actions which are deemed to be disruptive or harmful to our community ("Restricted Behaviours").

## Encouraged Behaviours

By acknowledging that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language, we agree to act in ways that reflect such sentiment:

- Engaging **kindly and honestly** with others.
- Being considerate of **differing opinions** and viewpoints.
- **Taking responsibility** for our actions and contributions.
- Gracefully giving and accepting **constructive feedback**.
- Committing to **repairing harm** when it occurs.

## Restricted Behaviours

We agree to restrict the following behaviours in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviours are violations of this Code of Conduct:

- **Character attacks**. Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative remarks directed at a community member, or group of people.
- **Endangerment**. Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm towards any person or group.
- **Failing to credit sources**. Not properly crediting the sources of content you contribute.
- **Harassment**. Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
- **Misleading identity**. Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
- **Promotional materials**. Sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that is outside the norms of the community.
- **Sexualization**. Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
- **Stereotyping or discrimination**. Making prejudicial remarks on the basis of immutable or personal characteristics, such as cultural background, age, and experience level.
- **Violating confidentiality**. Sharing or acting on someone’s personal or private information without their explicit consent.

## Enforcement Responsibility

The project maintainers currently serve as community moderators, responsible for clarifying and enforcing the standards of this Code of Conduct, although they may, at their discretion, delegate these responsibilities to one or more members of the community. As community moderators, they have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Reporting an Issue

Not every conflict represents a code of conduct violation; tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their best to collaborate.

When an incident does occur, it's important to report it promptly. Community moderators are obligated to investigate all and only formal complaints of code of conduct violation received at [michaelgauci.mt@gmail.com][Contact] and will make every effort to respond in a timely manner. Community moderators also commit to protect the safety and confidentiality of the parties involved, while striving to keep the investigation and any enforcement action taken as transparent as possible. To honour this dual commitment, enforcement actions are handled privately with the involved parties whenever possible, but the proceedings of their investigation and its outcomes may be communicated to the whole community as part of a mutually agreed-upon resolution, or when community moderators determine that disclosure is necessary to uphold the integrity of the process and their duty to enforce this Code of Conduct.

## Enforcement Guidelines

If an investigation by the community moderators finds that this Code of Conduct has been violated, the following enforcement ladder will be used to determine the appropriate course of action, based on the incident's impact on the individuals involved and the community as a whole. Depending on the severity of a violation, lower rungs on the ladder may be skipped.

#### 1. Warning

**Event**: A violation involving a single incident or series of incidents.
**Consequence**: A private, written warning from the community moderators.
**Repair**: Examples of repair include a private written apology, acknowledgement of responsibility, and seeking clarification on expectations.

#### 2. Restriction

**Event**: A repeated incidence of a violation which previously resulted in a warning, or the first incidence of a more serious violation.
**Consequence**: A private, written warning with a time-limited cooldown period designed to underscore the seriousness of the situation and give the community members involved time to process the incident. The cooldown period may be limited to particular communication channels or interactions with particular community members.
**Repair**: Examples of repair may include making an apology, using the cooldown period to reflect on actions and impact, and being thoughtful about re-entering community spaces after the period is over.

#### 3. Suspension

**Event**: A pattern of repeated violation which the Community Moderators have tried to address with warnings, or a single serious violation.
**Consequence**: A private written warning with conditions for return from suspension. In general, temporary suspensions give the person being suspended time to reflect upon their behaviour and possible corrective actions.
**Repair**: Examples of repair include respecting the spirit of the suspension, meeting the specified conditions for return, and being thoughtful about how to reintegrate with the community when the suspension is lifted.

#### 4. Expulsion

**Event**: A pattern of repeated violations that other steps on the ladder have failed to resolve, or a violation so serious that the community moderators determine there is no way to keep the community safe with this person as a member.
**Consequence**: Access to all community spaces, tools, and communication channels is removed. In general, expulsions should be rarely used, should have strong reasoning behind them, and should only be resorted to if working through other remedies has failed to change the behaviour.
**Repair**: There is no possible repair in cases of this severity.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to the project's issue tracker, pull requests, discussion forum, and any other future communication channels used by the project.

It also applies to any public space where an individual is representing the project. Examples of representation include posting via the project's official social media account or speaking as a designated representative at an event.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is modelled after the [Contributor Covenant 3.0][CoC]. The enforcement ladder was inspired by the work of [Mozilla’s code of conduct team][Mozilla CoC].
